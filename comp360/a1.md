##Question 1 

###a) $\sqrt{n} + n \sqrt{n} = O(n^2)$ 
For this statement to be true we must find a $c$ and a $n_0$ such that $\exists c, n_0 \gt 0 \space \forall n > n_0 \space. f(n) \leq cg(n) $ . By setting $c=1$ we can plot and find the intersection of the two functions which is when $n=2.14$. 
Breaking the equation into $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{n}} {n^2} = 0 $  and  $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n^{3/2}} {n^2} = 0 $ shows that both part of $f(n)$ grows slower than $g(n)$, therefore $f(n)$ will also grow slower than $g(n)$.
This shows that for $c = 1 , n_0 = 3 \space f(n) \leq c\cdot g(n) $ . 

###b) $(n+\log_2{n})^{5} =\theta(n^5) $ 
Show that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n + log_2{n}} {n} = b $  .
 $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n } {n} + \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{log_2{n} } {n} = 1 + 0$  . we see that the ratio of both function converges to 1 for a large enough n. Also show that $f(n) = c1\cdot g(n)$ and $g(n) = c2 \cdot f(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$ : 
 the plot of first equation shows that $c1 = 1 , n1 = 2$
