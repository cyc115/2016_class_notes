2 integrity constraints that must be true ut cannot be expressed in ERM is : 

1. Duration of the series must be in 30 min increment, however there's no direct way of reinforcing this. One way to solve it is to convert minutes to increments and store that in the duration field. For example a value of 2 in the duration field will convert to 60 min. 
2. Time of the slot cannot be restricted to be only in the defined interval of [6:00 .. 24:00]
