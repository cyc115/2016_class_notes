2 integrity constraints that must be true ut cannot be expressed in ERM is : 

1. Duration of the series must be in 30 min increment, however there's no direct way of reinforcing this. One way to solve it is to convert minutes to increments and store that in the duration field. For example a value of 2 in the duration field will convert to 60 min. 
2. Time of the slot cannot be restricted to be only in the defined interval of [6:00 .. 24:00]

1. This one works, since room and tenant is a one to one relationship. It guarantees that the entries referred by `relate` Relationship will exist. 
2.  This one does not guarantee that `tid` in `room` is a valid `tid` in `tenant` 
3. This one works too since `occupied room` is one to one with `tenants` and `rid` referenced by `tenants` is guaranteed to be a `occupied room` with valid `rid` and vice versa. 

###2 

I would prefer the first one since it is the most concise one of all three
