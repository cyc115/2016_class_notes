###A
#### breadth first search

The best way to describe this method is through pseudocode
 
```javascript 

start = Gare Du Nord
destination = Roi Baudoin

neighbours = {}
complete = false //indicate when result is found

neighbours.push()

while( !complete and !neighbours.empty() ){
	
	currentStation = neighbours.pop()
	
	if (currentStation is destination) {
		complete = true 
		break out of while
	}
	
	//first set the Station#parent to be the currentStation so that we can latter backtrack 
	neighbours.forEach( n => n.parent = currentStation ) ;   
	
	//assuming Queue#add(List l) is a valid method
	neighbours.add(currentStation.neighbours)
	
}

//backtrack to get the path 
path = {}
node = destination 
path.add(node) 

while ( node != start ) {
	path.add(node.parent) 
	node = node.parent
}
path.add(start)

//reverse the list to get the forward path 
result = reverseList (path) 
```

####Uniform cost search 

exact same result because the cost of the transition all equal to 1

####Depth first search 

Same algorithm but use a stack instead of Queue for `neighbours`. This will explore the graph in counterclockwise fashion. Which in this example is actually the fastest since the destination is at the left most side of the starting station.

####Iterative deepening 

Assuming search depth increases by 1 on every iteration, then the algorithm will yield identical result as BFS. As we increases the increment it will then gradually grow into DFS. 

###B

####BFS
 Identical to part A

####UCS
Similar to Part A except the algorithm will now explore two stations of cost one for every station of cost 2 

####DFS
Identical to part A 

####Iterative deepening 
Similar to Part A except the algorithm will now explore two stations of cost one for every station of cost 2.

###C

The heuristic it is admissible for this question given the condition that the cost stated in part a) is unit cost. Partly because it is very easy to compute and partly because the calculation will yield optimistic guesses. 

We should introduce a multiplicative factor $\alpha$ to the Euclidean distance between stations in hope to scale the heuristic below the actual cost of transport for all stations. Multiplicative factor $\alpha$ can be used in this case because the heuristic function is linear. $\alpha$ will work only for linear heuristic functions because they share the same growth rate. 

###D

The driving distance will not be an admissible heuristic for the following reasons :
1. It is more difficult to compute driving distances. 
2. The variance of driving distance between stations may be very high and may not be optimistic in some cases. 
3. It is possible that some locations cannot be reached by car.  


##Question 2

a. Yes. Uniform cost search explores the cheapest node among all "open" neighbouring nodes (nodes that are not yet assessed but are readily accessible from a previously explored node). Breadth first search **is** a special case of UCS when the cost of all open nodes are identical. In this particular case, the exploration of neighbouring nodes will follow the chronological ordering of the insertion of neighbouring nodes into the "open" priority queue.

b. Yes. Best first search expands the node that is closest to the goal on the ground that it is likely to lead to a solution quickly using only a heuristic function h(n). The algorithm will always prefer the go down a path in case where the cost of a node on depth (k+1) is strictly less than the cost of any node on depth of k. Depth first search is achieved in such case.

c. Yes. In case of A* search, we have explore the node with the lowest cost function f where `f(n) = h(n) + g(n)`. When h(n) is set to 0, the cost will only be concerned with cumulated cost of the path being evaluated. In such case, it is no different than an uniform cost search. 

##Question 3

> ![Hillclimbing function ](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-00HEOLcCivs/VqotQs2FPoI/AAAAAAAACRs/etLbHRibjOc/s0/Selection_099.jpg "Selection_099.jpg")

a) applying the hill-climbing starting form X_0 = {0,1,..,10} and deltaX = {0.01, 0.02, .. ,0.1}. The maximized Y value is 0.7618221938, which can be obtained by starting from the following x's : {0,1,2,3}, starting from 4 and onward will not result in an optimal solution unless we further increase deltaX beyond 0.1 . Optimizing from x=0 with increment of 0.01 will take the most number of steps (168). The second most steps are taken starting from x=3 with 0.01 increments. The high number of cycles required for value to converge is partially due to the choice of small increment value as well as the distance between the starting X (which is 0 and 3) from the optimal x (which is 1.67).


b) in this part, I have implemented two variants of simulated annealing with a range of different temperatures. The basic idea is as following (see code for more info) 
``` 
x := arbitrary starting point in range {0, 10} 
y := result of evaluation of f(x) 
dx := 0.01 (step size)
  
while (solution not found) {
	nx := generateNeighbourX();
	steps := 0 // number of steps taken
	
	//out of domain check omitted 
	y0 := eval(x-dx)
	y1 := eval(x)
	y2 := eval(x+dx)
	y3 := eval(nx) 
	
	//depending on the temp function, we will us nx as next x even if it's suboptimal 	
	temp := tempFunction(steps) 
	takeRisk = RandomFloat() <= temp ? true : false
	
	if (takeRisk) {
		x:= nx
	}
	
	if (y1 is the max value out of all y's) {
		we have found a maximum so return x as the solution
	}
	else {
		take the x corresponding to the best y and loop again  
	}
 
}

```
I have assumed that dx will be 0.01 so it is less likely to jump away from the optimal hill due to the lack of precision. Also I have made the assumption that `generateNeighbourX()` returns a random x value in the range of [0..10] . This choice was made so that we will have a bigger chance of jumping out of a suboptimal path. 

I have tried two temperature functions, the first one being : 

####  $T = 1 - e^{-\frac{1}{(step+1)/2}}$. 

> **note**
> - 1 is added to step to prevent division by 0 
> - 2 is divided to slow down the degradation 
> - 1 subtracts the exponential function so that the entire function converges to +0.
 
 The second one being :

#### $ \forall steps . \space T = 0$ 

In which case the program will not take any suboptimal x and continues.

In comparing the naive method, and the two forms of temperature functions(degrading and zero) . I have noticed that contrary to intuition, the zero temperature function outperforms both the naive method and the degrading temperature function by a gushing 18% and 41%. This result was tested with 11 x's ranging from {0..10} with dx = 0.01 and 100 trials for each x. A trial is successful if the result is $y \geq 0.761 $ . 

| method | rate of success | mean # steps | stdiv # steps | median | 
|:--:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|
| naive | 0.36 | 101 |52.87| 101 |
| degrading | 0.59 |42.28 |23.76| 38 | 
| zero | 0.77 | 26.78 |12.98| 26 |
